    "\n",
    "Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been identified globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Variants are determined by their genetic sequences. The term variant of interest (VOI) is used to describe a newly emerging variant for which the medical and public health importance is not yet known. If a variant is thought to be more contagious or likely to cause greater illness or severe disease, or may impact treatment or vaccine response, then it is considered a variant of concern (VOC). \n",
    "\n",
    "**What do we know about the variants of concern?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variants are associated with approximately 50% increased transmission, and likely with increased disease severity and risk of death. Appears to have minimal impact on the effectiveness of treatments with antibodies.\n",
    "- B.1.351 (Beta) variants are associated with approximately 50% increased transmission. May have moderately decreased response to antibody treatments.\n",
    "- P.1 (Gamma) variants may have moderately decreased response to some antibody treatments.\n",
    "- B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants are associated with increased transmission. May have moderately decreased response to antibody treatments. (Delta totals include Delta sub-lineages AY.1 and AY.2)\n",
    "- B.1.1.529, BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5 (Omicron) Variants have increased transmissibility, reduction in neutralization by some EUA monoclonal antibody treatments, and significant reduction in neutralization by post-vaccination or post-infection sera."
